\section{Higgs bosons}

Higgs bosons are particles that arise through electroweak symmetry breaking. A principal motivation for the Large Hadron Collider physics programme was the testing of the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking, through the observation of Higgs bosons. In July of 2012, the existence of the Higgs boson was confirmed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Following this discovery, further studies have been ongoing in order to examine the character of the particle.
